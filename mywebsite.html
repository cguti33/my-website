        <p>Roat√°n is an island in the Caribbean, about 65 kilometres off the northern coast of Honduras. The largest of the Bay Islands of Honduras, it is located between the islands of Utila and Guanaja.
        Roatan is widely known for having some of the best scuba diving and snorkeling on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. Looking at the popularity of the Caribbean overall, Roatan is still relatively untouched.
        Roatan Island has an international airport located in Coxen Hole and receives direct flights from North and Central America.</p>
